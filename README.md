Tips that made TinkerCad much more useful

### Drop a part to the workplane
`d` will drop a part so that it touches the workplane

### Make parts touch each other
If you have two parts that you want to actually touch, you can press `w` to align the workplane to a face on one of the parts. You can then press `d` to drop the other part to that newly created workplane. If you drop the part and it goes to the wrong side of the workplane, you might have to press `shift + click`  the workplane in order to invert it.

### Align parts based on one of the parts

If you select more than one part, you can press the align icon (or press the `L` key) and then select the nodes to align to. That will move both parts. If you only want to move one of the parts, after you press the align icon, click on the one object that you would like to use as a reference and that will then remain stationairy.

### Rotate a part to align with a workplane

1. Set a custom workplane on the face of the object you want to lay flat.
2. Copy the object while that custom workplane is active.
3. Reset the workplane to the default position
4. Paste the object.

### Snap Grid

The default setting for snapping an object is 1mm. That can be adjusted in the bottom right corner of the workspace view. This can be helpful when using the keyboard to help align and move things.

### Create a grid

Search the shapes for grid. There are multiple styles of grid available. Adjust the size parameters and then can make it a negative in order to greate a spaces in another object.
